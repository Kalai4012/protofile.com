I am KALAISELVAN A, hailing from the state of Tamilnadu.
I am presently pursuing B.E in computer science engineering from the Annai mira college of engineering, Vellore.
Moreover, I am proficient as well as a capable and confident person.
I have learned to be very hard-working as well as passionate about my career from the very core.
Since my childhood, I have always been trained to focus on my passion.

I never pursued bookish knowledge and it is certainly true that only a book
doesn’t let you have sufficient experience and knowledge about the practical world.
Training myself as a Programmer and always keeping myself balanced with my career had finally made me reach, where I am today.
Recently I am also learning a new course on Programming language like python,java,mysql and I keep trying to finish on it too.


My father is a former and My mother is a housewife.
We weave our present to see a beautiful design in the future.

As a role model, I always look upon the Elon mask as my inspiration and I always dream to be like him.
I am driven by his enthusiasm, energy, and vitality with which he done in his life and made the world to see him who is he.
