                    <h2>KALAISELVAN S</h2> 
                <p> I am KALAISELVAN S, hailing from the state of Tamilnadu.
                        I am presently pursuing B.E in computer science engineering from the Annai mira college of engineering, Vellore.
                        Moreover, I am proficient as well as a capable and confident person.
                        I have learned to be very hard-working as well as passionate about my career from the very core.
                        Since my childhood, I have always been trained to focus on my passion.
                        
                        I never pursued bookish knowledge and it is certainly true that only a book
                        doesnâ€™t let you have sufficient experience and knowledge about the practical world.
                        Training myself as a Programmer and always keeping myself balanced with my career had finally made me reach, where I am today.
                        Recently I am also learning a new course on Programming language like python,java,mysql and I keep trying to finish on it too.
                        
                        
                        My father is a former and My mother is a housewife.
                        We weave our present to see a beautiful design in the future.
                        
                        As a role model, I always look upon the Elon mask as my inspiration and I always dream to be like him.
                        I am driven by his enthusiasm, energy, and vitality with which he done in his life and made the world to see him who is he.</p>
